### My Learnings
* An Activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.
* All components for an app, such as multiple activities, must be declared in XML file.
* Log messages are a powerful debugging tool that you can use to check on values, execution paths, and report exceptions.
* We can edit the AndroidManifest.xml file to add features, components and permissions to your Android app.
