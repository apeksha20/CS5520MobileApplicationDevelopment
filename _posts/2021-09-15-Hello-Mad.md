### My Learnings
* An Activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.
* All components for an app, such as multiple activities, must be declared in XML file.
* Log messages are a powerful debugging tool that you can use to check on values, execution paths, and report exceptions.
* We can edit the AndroidManifest.xml file to add features, components and permissions to your Android app.


### Homework

**Question 1**

What is the name of the layout file for the main activity?

* MainActivity.java

* AndroidManifest.xml

* **activity_main.xml**

* build.gradle


**Question 2**

What is the name of the string resource that specifies the application's name?  

* **app_name**
* xmlns:app
* android:name
* applicationId

**Question 3**

Which tool do you use to create a new emulator?  

* Android Device Monitor. 
* **AVD Manager**
* SDK Manager 
* Theme Edito

**Question 4**

Assume that your app includes this logging statement:  

Log.i("MainActivity", "MainActivity layout is complete");
You see the statement "MainActivity layout is complete" in the Logcat pane if the Log level menu is set to which of the following? (Hint: multiple answers are OK.)

* **Verbose**
* **Debug** 
* **Info** 
* Warn
* Error
* Assert

### My Learnings
* The View class represents the basic building block for all UI components, and the base class for classes that provide interactive UI components such as buttons, checkboxes, and text entry fields.
* The Attributes pane offers access to all of the XML attributes you can assign to a UI element.
* Avoid hardcoding sizes for most View elements, because hardcoded dimensions can't adapt to different content and screen sizes.
