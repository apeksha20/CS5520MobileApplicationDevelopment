### What I did..
* Created my first android app which is a simple TODO app, through which we can add a task, its details, set the tag priority to high, medium, low and set a deadline date.  
* The main activity/screen displays any created tasks as a **Listview** and an option to add a new task. The created task has a checkbox to indicate if the task is done or not. On clicking the task color changes to yellow.  
* On click of the created task on the home page, the task details open up where you can edit the task.
* On Click of the + icon on the main activity, opens another activity where a user can add task and its details.

### My learnings
* Learnt about singleton design pattern, where the app has only single instance of data.
* We can access the data from anywhere in the app as it is global. 
* Learnt about adapter which acts a bridge between adapterview and underlying data for that view. Data --> Adapter --> Listview
* Learnt about android listners and how to use them on click events.
